This is the Basic version. Updates will keep dropping.
Finding perimeter of triangle is not exactly perfect since it asks alue of all 3 sides and equations usually dont mention all 3 sides (will work on a fix).
The only reason i used C++ instead of a rather easier program for this task like python is just because I am trying to get used to C++.


<===========================Patch_28-05-2022===========================>
Changes:
  <> Explaination for the Perimeter of Cicle has been more simplified 
      (Take 5 as radius)
  
      Before: For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation
              5 * 3.14 * 2 = 31.4
      
      After:  For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation
              2 * 3.14 * 5 = 31.4
      
      Why did I do this?
      answer: The formula mentions 2 * Pi * R and the format of answer previously (5 * 3.14 * 2) makes the formula more confusing.
