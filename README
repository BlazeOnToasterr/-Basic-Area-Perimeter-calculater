# Patch: 
 <===========================Patch_28-05-2022===========================>
  Changes:
    <> Explaination for the Perimeter of Cicle has been more simplified 
        (Take 5 as radius)

        Before: For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation
                5 * 3.14 * 2 = 31.4

        After:  For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation
                2 * 3.14 * 5 = 31.4

        Why did I do this?
        answer: The formula mentions 2 * Pi * R and the format of answer previously (5 * 3.14 * 2) makes the formula more confusing.


  
    <> Added a Reuse function
      Before: Your Answer is: 1
      Do you want to know how to find the answer to this problem?
      Type '1' if yes
      Type '2' if no
      2
      Task has ended

      After: Your Answer is: 1
      Do you want to know how to find the answer to this problem?
      Type '1' if yes
      Type '2' if no
      2
      Okay!
      Do you want to reuse this task?
      Type '1' if yes
      type '2' if no

  We have noted: 
    <> Finding perimeter of triangle requires you to enter all 3 sides of the triangle.
    <> The Program looks very confusing in the terminal.
