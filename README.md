# Patch
 <br /> <===========================Patch_28-05-2022===========================> <br /> <br />
  Changes: <br />
    <> Explaination for the Perimeter of Cicle has been more simplified <br />
        (Take 5 as radius) <br /> <br />
       Before: For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation <br />
                5 * 3.14 * 2 = 31.4 <br /> <br />
       After:  For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation <br />
                2 * 3.14 * 5 = 31.4 <br /> <br />
       Why did I do this? <br />
       answer: The formula mentions 2 * Pi * R and the format of answer previously (5 * 3.14 * 2) makes the formula more confusing. <br />
    <> Added a Reuse function <br />
      Before: Your Answer is: 1 <br />
      Do you want to know how to find the answer to this problem? <br />
      Type '1' if yes <br />
      Type '2' if no <br />
      2 <br />
      Task has ended <br /> <br />
      After: Your Answer is: 1  <br />
      Do you want to know how to find the answer to this problem? <br />
      Type '1' if yes <br />
      Type '2' if no <br />
      2 <br />
      Okay! <br />
      Do you want to reuse this task? <br />
      Type '1' if yes <br /> 
      type '2' if no <br /> <br /> 

  We have noted: <br />
    <> Finding perimeter of triangle requires you to enter all 3 sides of the triangle. <br />
    <> The Program looks very confusing in the terminal. <br />
