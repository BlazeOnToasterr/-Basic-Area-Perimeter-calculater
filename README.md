# Patch
<br /> <===========================Patch_01-06-2022===========================> <br /> <br />
<> Added new Operations <br />
  Before: <==========Selection==========> <br />
          are you trying to find a perimeter or an area. <br />
          Type '1' for finding Area <br />
          Type '2' to find perimeter <br /> <br />
  After:  <==========Selection==========>  <br />
          are you trying to find a perimeter or an area. <br />
         Type '1' for finding Area <br />
          Type '2' to find perimeter <br /> 
          Type '3' for using all operations (+.-,*,*) <br />
          3 <br />
Enter 1st number for operation: <br />
5 <br />
Enter 2nd number for operation: <br />
10 <br /> <br />

<===========Substraction===========> <br />
Your 1st Substraction result is: 5 - 10 = -5 <br />
Your 2nd Substraction result is: 10 - 5 = 5 <br /> <br />

<=============Addition=============> <br /> 
Your Addition result is: 5 + 10 = 15 <br /> <br />

<=============Division=============> <br />
Your 1st Division result is: 5 / 10 = 0.5 <br /> 
Your 2nd Division result is: 10 / 5 = 2 <br /> <br />

<==========Multiplication==========> <br />
Your Multiplication result is: 5 * 10 = 50 <br />

<br /> <===========================Patch_29-05-2022===========================> <br /> <br />
  Changes: <br />
    <> All Explainations have been Uniformed. <br />
      (Take 5 as base and height) <br /> <br />
      before: Area of triangle= in this situation: 5 * 5 and divide it by half = 12.5 <br />
              Perimeter of triangle= in this situation: 5&ensp; * &ensp;5 and divide it by half = 12.5 <br />
      <br /> After: Area of triangle= in this situation: 5  *  5 and divide it by half = 12.5 <br />
             Perimeter of triangle=   in this situation: 5  *  5 and divide it by half = 12.5 <br />
              <br /> (This might not look like a big change but it looks less complex.)  <br /> <br /> <br /> 
    <> The Program is more spacious <br />
      Before: In this equation,  <br />
        The formula of finding the area of a Triangle is base multiplied by height multiplied by half. <br />
        in this situation: 5 * 5 and divide it by half = 12.5 <br /> 
        Do you want to reuse this task? <br />
        Type '1' if yes <br /> 
        type '2' if no <br />
      <br /> After: In this equation,  <br />
        The formula of finding the area of a Triangle is base multiplied by height multiplied by half. <br />
        in this situation: 5 * 5 and divide it by half = 12.5 <br /> <br />
        Do you want to reuse this task? <br /> 
        Type '1' if yes <br /> 
        type '2' if no <br /> <br /> 
        (There are several more similar changes to make it look simple and spacious) <br /> 
        We have noted: <br />
    <> Finding perimeter of triangle requires you to enter all 3 sides of the triangle. <br />
        ********************************************************************************* <br />  <br /> 

<br /> <===========================Patch_28-05-2022===========================> <br /> <br />
  Changes: <br />
    <> Explaination for the Perimeter of Circle has been more simplified <br />
        (Take 5 as radius) <br /> <br />
       Before: For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation <br />
                5 * 3.14 * 2 = 31.4 <br /> <br />
       After:  For finding the Perimeter of the circle, the formula is 2 * Pi * R. In this situation <br />
                2 * 3.14 * 5 = 31.4 <br /> <br />
       Why did I do this? <br />
       answer: The formula mentions 2 * Pi * R and the format of answer previously (5 * 3.14 * 2) makes the formula more confusing. <br />
    <> Added a Reuse function <br />
      Before: Your Answer is: 1 <br />
      Do you want to know how to find the answer to this problem? <br />
      Type '1' if yes <br />
      Type '2' if no <br />
      2 <br />
      Task has ended <br /> <br />
      After: Your Answer is: 1  <br />
      Do you want to know how to find the answer to this problem? <br />
      Type '1' if yes <br />
      Type '2' if no <br />
      2 <br />
      Okay! <br />
      Do you want to reuse this task? <br />
      Type '1' if yes <br /> 
      type '2' if no <br /> <br /> 

  We have noted: <br />
    <> Finding perimeter of triangle requires you to enter all 3 sides of the triangle. <br />
    <> The Program looks very confusing in the terminal. <br />
